## Extra Reading

I developed this over my 2022 First Year Summer Holidays, to provide an alternative to accessing UNSW's Arc website which was undergoing changes at the time. I wished to provide further functionality like if there was free food etc, or sortable tags if the club was recruiting new Executives, Directors or Subcommittee. This was designed to help first years make their way into societies, but I realised that I needed a lot more web dev knowledge to make it fully functional.

for now though, this is what I've created during my first year at university using

- ReactJS
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS

and deployed using Vercel accessible here: https://uniclubs.vercel.app
